# Apple-Ecosystem-Replicator

I should preface this by saying, 99% of people in this situation should just buy an Iphone, this process is complicated, expensive, and time intensive however for me the result was worth it. I wanted to put this up just incase anyone else wanted to completley replicate the Apple Ecosystem on an Android phone.

# Important Links / Credit

There are many important components to this, but the main ones are:

# Cost

This project will run you around 300$ for a good reliable setup, you can definetley do it with cheaper Iphones and a Mac Mini, but for me I got really lucky on facebook Marketplace/Ebay so Ill break down the cost.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The Mac Mini / Iphone need to be specific versions, specifically MacOS Ventura+ and a version of an Iphone that can be jailbroken.

### Components

1. Mac Mini 2020 32GB - 200$
2. Iphone X 256gb (SIM locked) - 50$
3. Iphone 8 256gb (Unlocked) - 30$
4. Domain - 20$

# Setting Everything Up

> [!WARNING]  
> You technically dont need BlueBubbles, or even a Mac Mini at all for this however it makes the process much more streamlined 

1. The first step is to set up the Mac Mini, and there are a couple of things that you need to install for this to work.
